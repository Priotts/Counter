## Counter - S2I

Welcome to my [counter site](https://priotts.github.io/Counter/)! Here you can find information about how it was made and how to clone it.

## Description
The site was created using HTML, CSS and JAVA SCRIPT. The JavaScript application allows the user to increment, decrement, and reset the counter value. The application will appear as soon as the start key is pressed.

## Project features
- The application is developed with JavaScript without the use of any frameworks.
- The increment, decrement, and reset buttons were made using java scripts.
- The site is designed to be responsive on all devices through the use of media queries
  
## Info
In the first version there were some global variables and repetitive functions, which as described in the various guides are not the best for code safety and readability. Therefore, I opted to eliminate the global variables and use the createButton function with arguments.
